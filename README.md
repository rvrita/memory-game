#Matching Game

This is the README file for my Matching Game.

#Overview

The game has 16 cards.
A user can click two cards each turn. 
If they are a match, the cards stay overturned. Otherwise, both cards flip back over.
A score display shows how many matches a user has made.
If the user matches all the cards, a congratulations message will display.
A reset button will restart the game and reset the cards.

#Rules

This is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

#Code

The game logic is written entirely in vanilla Javascript.
